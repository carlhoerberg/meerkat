Meerkat
=======

Rack middleware for [Server-Sent Events (HTML5 SSE)](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/).

Requires an [EventMachine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine#readme) backed server, like [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) or [Rainbows](http://rainbows.rubyforge.org/) (with the EventMachine backend only).

Features: 

* Realtime events
* Extremely efficent
* Broad browser support (both desktop and mobile browsers)
* Works with all proxies (unlike WebSockets)
* Subscribe to single events
* Subscribe to multiple events via patterns
* Publish messages from the server
* Publish messages from the client (via POST)

Supported backends: 

* In memory, using [EventMachine Channels](http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Channel.html), good for single server usage.
* RabbitMQ (AMQP), using the [AMQP gem](https://github.com/amqp/amqp-ruby) and the Pub/Sub pattern (Topic exchange + anonymous queues with pattern matching). AMQP is the most recommened alternative.
* Redis, using [em-hiredis](https://github.com/mloughran/em-hiredis#readme) and the [Pub/Sub API](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub). 
* Postgres, using the [Notify/Listen API](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-notify.html). 
  * When a message is published the topic and json payload is inserted into the 'meerkat_pubsub' table, and then a NOTIFY is issued.
  * Listening clients recivies the notification and reads the message from the table and writes it to the Event Stream of its clients.
  * On the next publish all messages older than 5 seconds are deleted. 
  * No polling is ever done.
  * This works with PostgreSQL 8 and higher (tested with 8.3 and 9.1). 

Usage
-----

Put meerkat and pg or em-hiredis in your Gemfile, depending on which backend you plan to use. 
Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'meerkat'
gem 'amqp'
# or
gem 'pg'
# or
gem 'em-hiredis'
```
Require meerkat and the backend you would like to use. 

config.ru: 

```ruby
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'meerkat' 
require 'meerkat/backend/amqp' 
#require 'meerkat/backend/pg' 
#require 'meerkat/backend/redis' 
#require 'meerkat/backend/inmemory' 
require './app'

#Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::InMemory.new 
Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::AMQP.new 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost'
#Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::Redis.new 'redis://localhost/0'
#Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::PG.new :dbname => 'postgres'
map '/' do
  run App
end
map '/stream' do
  run Meerkat::RackAdapter.new
end
```

On the client:

```javascript
var source = new EventSource('/stream/foo');
var streamList = document.getElementById('stream');
// Use #onmessage if you only listen to one topic
source.onmessage = function(e) {
  var li = document.createElement('li');
  li.innerHTML = JSON.parse(e.data);
  streamList.appendChild(li);
}

var multiSource = new EventSource('/stream/foo.*');
// You have to add custom event listerns when you 
// listen on multiple topics
multiSource.addEventListener('foo.bar', function(e) {
  // Do something
}, false);
multiSource.addEventListener('foo.foo', function(e) {
  // Do something
}, false);
```

To push things from the server:

```ruby
Meerkat.publish "foo.bar", { :any => 'hash' } # the hash will automatically be json encoded
Meerkat.publish "foo.bar", 'any string'
Meerkat.publish "foo.foo", myobj.to_json, true # the third parameter indicates that the message already is json encoded
```

The published objects will be JSON serialized before sent to the backend. You'll have to deserialize it in the client. 

From the client:

```javascript
$.post('/stream', { topic: 'foo.bar', data: JSON.stringify(my_object) })
$.post('/stream/foo.bar', { data: JSON.stringify(my_object) })
```

A simple POST request, with a parameter called 'data' (or 'json' or 'msg') containing a JSON string.

The topic can be specified other as a post parameter or in the path.

Examples
--------

A simple demo can be seen here: 
http://meerkat-demo.herokuapp.com/

It's deployed on [Heroku's Cedar stack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar). It's using the Redis backend, thanks to [Redis To Go](https://redistogo.com/)'s free Nano offering.
