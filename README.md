Meerkat
=======

Rack middleware for [Server-Sent Events (HTML5 SSE)](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/).

Requires an [EventMachine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine#readme) backed server, like [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) or [Rainbows](http://rainbows.rubyforge.org/) (with the EventMachine backend only).

Supported backends: 

 * In memory, using [EventMachine Channels](http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Channel.html), good for single server usage.
 * Redis, using [em-hiredis](https://github.com/mloughran/em-hiredis#readme) and the [Pub/Sub API](http://redis.io/topics/pubsub). 
 * Postgres, using the [Notify/Listen API](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-notify.html). 
   * When a message is published the topic and json payload is inserted into the 'meerkat_pubsub' table, and then a NOTIFY is issued.
   * Listening clients recivies the notification and reads the message from the table and writes it to the Event Stream of its clients.
   * On the next publish all messages older than 5 seconds are deleted. 
   * No polling is ever done.
   * This works with PostgreSQL 8 and higher (tested with 8.3 and 9.1). 

Usage
-----

config.ru: 

```ruby
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'meerkat' 
require './app'

#Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::InMemory.new 
#Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::Redis.new 'redis://localhost/0'
Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::PG.new :dbname => 'postgres'
map '/' do
  run App
end
map '/stream' do
  run Meerkat::RackAdapter.new
end
```

On the client:

```javascript
var source = new EventSource('/stream/mychannel');
var streamList = document.getElementById('stream');
source.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  var li = document.createElement('li');
  li.innerHTML = JSON.parse(e.data);
  streamList.appendChild(li);
}, false);
```

To push things:

```ruby
Meerkat.publish "/mychannel", {:any => hash}
Meerkat.publish "/mychannel/2", 'any string'
Meerkat.publish "/mychannel/3", any_object
```

The published objects will be JSON serialized (with [Yajl](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby)) before sent to the backend. Deserialize it in the client.

Examples
--------

A simple demo can be seen here: 
http://meerkat-demo.herokuapp.com/

It's deployed on [Heroku's Cedar stack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar). It's using the Redis backend, thanks to [Redis To Go](https://redistogo.com/)'s free Nano offering.
