Meerkat
=======

Rack middleware for [Server-Sent Events (HTML5 SSE)](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/).

Requires an evented server, like [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/).

Supported backends: 

 * In memory, using [EventMachine Channels](http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine/Channel.html), good for single server usage.
 * Redis, using [em-hiredis](https://github.com/mloughran/em-hiredis#readme). 
 * Postgres, using the [Notify/Listen API](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-notify.html). Note, this is totally async, no polling.

Usage
=====

```config.ru```:

    require 'bundler/setup'
    require 'meerkat' 
    require './app'

    #Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::InMemory.new 
    #Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::Redis.new 'redis://localhost/0'
    Meerkat.backend = Meerkat::Backend::PG.new :dbname => 'postgres'
    map '/' do
      run App
    end
    map '/stream' do
      run Meerkat::RackAdapter.new
    end

On the client:

    var source = new EventSource('/stream/mychannel');
    var streamList = document.getElementById('stream');
    source.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
      var li = document.createElement('li');
      li.innerHTML = JSON.parse(e.data);
      streamList.appendChild(li);
    }, false);

To push things:

    Meerkat.publish "/mychannel", {:any => hash}
    Meerkat.publish "/mychannel/2", 'any string'
    Meerkat.publish "/mychannel/3", any_object

The published object will be JSON serialized (with [Yajl](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby)) before sent to the backend. Deserialize it in the client.
